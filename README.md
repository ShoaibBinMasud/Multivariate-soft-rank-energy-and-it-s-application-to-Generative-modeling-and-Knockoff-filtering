# Multivariate soft rank energy: sample efficiency, consistency, and generative modeling
This repository provides two applications of novel multivariate soft rank energy (sRE) and soft rank mmd (sRMMD) towards developing a generative model. First, we use sRE and sRMMD as the loss functions in a simple generative model architecture to produce MNIST-digits. We then utilize the sRMMD in a deep generative model in order to produce valid knockoffs.
